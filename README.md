# Talk – «Liberate books»

# Format
Presentation (20min) or Lightning talk (5min) – what would serve best?

# Synopsis
The last two years I made some efforts to liberate older books. I worked on two books:

* One is a Dictonary (DE – EN – FR – NL) called «the printer's terms» of Rudolf Hostettler from 1947. Here the challenge was how to make a digital form of a dictionary that can live on.
* The other book is [«Widerstand braucht viele Sprachen»](http://www.edition8.ch/buch/widerstand-braucht-viele-sprachen/). The Book was published with Adobe InDesign and I wrote several Packages to process InDesign and other file formats in a interchangable format.

# Content
I would show some strategies to republish proprietary content. Plus I would present the Idea of the notzer interchange family to convert some formats (similar to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/))
